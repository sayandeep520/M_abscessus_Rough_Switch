### 01_Genomic_Evidence

This directory contains the **genomic and molecular evidence** underlying the smooth-to-rough morphotype switch in *Mycobacterium abscessus*. Analyses focus on mutation burden, indel patterns, and entropy shifts in key surface-associated loci, providing mechanistic insight into genotype-level drivers of virulence and phenotypic divergence.

Included are processed validation tables, publication-ready figures, and the corresponding Jupyter notebook implementing the genomic analysis pipeline.
