# Mycobacterium_Abscessus_TDA_Model
A multi-scale computational model of M. abscessus chronicity. Integrating TDA, genomics, and Game Theory, we reveal the 'Rough' variant is a metabolically efficient 'Topological Fortress.' Analysis proves a thermodynamic tipping point (c=1.7 ATP) drives the inevitable collapse from colonizing biofilms to incurable, drug-resistant infection.
